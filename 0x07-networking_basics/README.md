Resources:books:
Read or watch:

OSI model
Different types of network
LAN network
WAN network
Internet
MAC address
What is an IP address
Private and public address
IPv4 and IPv6
Localhost
TCP and UDP
TCP/UDP ports List
What is ping /ICMP
Positional parameters
Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

What it is
How many layers it has
How it is organized
0. OSI model
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
1. Types of network
2. MAC and IP address
3. UDP and TCP
4. TCP and UDP ports
Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.
5. Is the host on the network
